# Machine learning model for churn prevention in telecommunications

## 📉 Problem solving
I developed a machine learning model for Interconnect, a telecommunications company, to predict customer churn. I leveraged real data on user profiles, plans, and contracts to anticipate cancellations, enabling the marketing team to implement personalized retention strategies such as promotions and special plans.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a machine learning model which reaches an AUC-ROC greater than 0.85.

## 🚀 Tech stack
- *Languages:* python 
- *Data Science:* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- *Visualization:* matplotlib

## 🗝️ Key steps
1.- *Exploratory data analysis:* identify patterns, outliers, missing values, and initial correlations.  
2.- *Descriptive statistics:* resume and understand the main characteristics of data.  
3.- *Data preprocessing:* data cleansing, data imputation, data transformation, and variables codification.  
4.- *Model training:* train and test different classification models.  
5.- *Model evaluation:* evaluate the different classification models to find the most reliable one.  

## ✅ Results
I recommended to the telecommunications company the most reliable classification model, which is a Random Forest and it got an AUC-ROC score of 0.88.
